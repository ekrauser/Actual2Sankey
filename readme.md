Actual2Sankey

Super simple script that takes the raw output csv from actual budget for the last year (from todays date) and spits out an image of a sankey style flow

You'll need orca installed and added to your PATH

No changes needed to the csv before running the script assuming you setup your categories correctly. In my case existing "Debt" is its own category so that gets excluded and displayed as it's own total and "Income" and "Starting Balance" are the only two income sources.
